			  <medium>Started in 2016, AAS CITC quickly established itself as a excellent degree par excellence at Roane State. With its unique sequence of great courses that can be found nowhere else, it enjoys patronage from the A-list companies in the area. Featuring a great program director and great faculty in the IT field, you will love the content and the attention that you receive both face to face and online the next time you take any of our courses.</medium></p>
			  <large>The degree traces its humble beginnings to the cybersecurity concentration, a successful sequence of courses started by our director, <em>Dr. George Meghabghab</em>, that features for the first time the first cyber security competition at RSCC.</large></div>
